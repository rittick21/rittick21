💻⚡ Tech is my battlefield — and automation is my weapon!
I’m a passionate Cyber Security 🛡️ enthusiast with a deep love for Operating Systems 🧠, Networking 🌐, and hands-on Infra Management ⚙️.
I speak fluently in Python 🐍 and Bash 💥 — scripting my way through Automation 🤖 and system optimization.
From Linux 🐧 to Windows 🪟, from Virtualization 🧩 to Hypervisors 🚀, I build, manage, and secure digital environments with precision.
I explore Cisco Packet Tracer 🧠 for network design and master OS Firewalls 🔥 to keep threats at bay.
Always learning, always evolving — because tech never sleeps 💪💡
